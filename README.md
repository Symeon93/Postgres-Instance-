# Postgres-Instance-

Purpose of the project is to design a database where we will store data from crimes being reported in the Boston area; after creating the database 
we assign the privilliges to all users (according to standard practices) and finally we test if everything work as they supposed to.
We used Postgres as the database in which the data will be stored.

Lesson learned include managing SQLalchemy, using an API to interact with the database (open, define a cursor, execute, fetch data and finally close 
the connection) and executing database administration principles.
