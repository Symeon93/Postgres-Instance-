# Postgres-Instance-

Purpose of the project is to design a database where that will store data from crimes being reported in the Boston area after creating the database 
we assign the privilliges to all users (according to standard practices) and finally we test if everything work as they supposed to.
We used Postgres as the database in which the data will be stored.
